            <p>
                This website allows you to
                <strong>configure the delay for a YouTube Live Stream</strong>.
                The YouTube player will always keep the delay fixed. <br />

                If the current delay become shorter than the perfect by over
                <strong>1min</strong>, it will automatically be reset back. And
                if delay becomes longer than the configured by over
                <strong>1h</strong>, it will also be reset back.<br /><br />

                <strong>Example:</strong> So if configured delay is 900s (15min)
                and the current delay is 13min 59s, it will be reset back to
                15min. And if the current delay is 1h 15min 1s, it will be also
                reset back to 15min.<br /><br />

                To account for possible network issues that may increase the
                delay, we save the current delay and if skipping happens (which
                means delay becomes less then 60s) we will return back to the
                saved delay, and also increase delay by 5s.<br />

                But if delay becomes bad, but more than 60s it means it wasn't
                skipping but someone manually changed the timeline. In this case
                we will go to the configured delay (not saved one).<br /><br />

                <strong>Example:</strong> Lets say configured delay is 900s
                (15min), but due to network issues the current delay is 960s
                (16min). Now YT skips and delay becomes 0s. In this case we will
                reset delay back to 16min 5s.
