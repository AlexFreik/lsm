# LSM: Live Streaming Monitors

## [ZAM: Zoom Auto Monitor](https://alexfreik.github.io/lsm/zam/)

`JS` script that solves the issue when co-hosts
click the "Mute All" button and mute the host. And other
similar issues like a removed spotlight.

## [YAD: YouTube Auto Delay](https://alexfreik.github.io/lsm/yad/)

Webpage where you can configure a delay for any YouTube
stream, and it will automatically maintain it. It solves the
skipping problem when because of network lag a stream with delay
goes to LIVE, and as a result, participants miss this skipped fragment.

## [YouTube Gallery View](https://alexfreik.github.io/lsm/gallery/)

Here you can monitor multiple YouTube streams simultaneously.
