# LSM: Live Streaming Monitors

## [YAD: YouTube Auto Delay](https://alexfreik.github.io/lsm/yad/)

Webpage where you can configure a delay for any YouTube
stream, and it will automatically maintain it. It solves the
skipping problem when because of network lag a stream with delay
goes to LIVE, and as a result, participants miss this skipped fragment.

## [Live Streaming Gallery](https://alexfreik.github.io/lsm/gallery/)

Here you can monitor multiple YouTube, Facebook, Zoom, and other streams simultaneously.

It provides usefull features:

-   Audio VU meter, which shows audio levels on the right side.
-   Sets lowest quality for all playing YouTube videos.
-   Blinks or beeps if currently spotlighted person in Zoom is muted.
-   And others!

## [Gallery Chrome Extension](https://alexfreik.github.io/lsm/gallery-ext/)

Because of the CORS policy, we can't access the videos with JavaScript directly.

That is why a Chrome Extension is required to enable VU meters, lowest quality selection, and other features.

## [VOD: Video on Demand](https://alexfreik.github.io/lsm/vod/)
