# LSM: Live Streaming Monitors

## [YAD: YouTube Auto Delay](https://alexfreik.github.io/lsm/yad/)

Webpage where you can configure a delay for any YouTube
stream, and it will automatically maintain it. It solves the
skipping problem when because of network lag a stream with delay
goes to LIVE, and as a result, participants miss this skipped fragment.

## [Live Streaming Gallery](https://alexfreik.github.io/lsm/gallery/)

Here you can monitor multiple YouTube streams simultaneously.

## [Gallery Chrome Extension](https://alexfreik.github.io/lsm/gallery-ext/)

Because of the CORS policy, we can't access the videos with JavaScript directly.

That is why a Chrome Extension is required to enable VU meters, automatic quality adjustment, always staying on LIVE and other features.

## [VOD: Video on Demand](https://alexfreik.github.io/lsm/vod/)

This webpage simulates a YouTube video as if it is being streamed live.

## [ZAM: Zoom Auto Monitor](https://alexfreik.github.io/lsm/zam/)

`JS` script that solves the issue when co-hosts
click the "Mute All" button and mute the host. And other
similar issues like a removed spotlight.
