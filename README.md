# LSM: Live Streaming Monitors

## ZAM: Zoom Auto Monitor
`JS` script that solves the issue when co-hosts
click the "Mute All" button and mute the host. And other
similar issues like a removed spotlight.

## YAD: YouTube Auto Delay
Webpage where you can configure a delay for any YouTube
stream, and it will automatically maintain it. It solves the
skipping problem when because of network lag a stream with delay
goes to LIVE, and as a result, participants miss this skipped fragment.
