# Gallery Chrome Extension

Because of the CORS policy, we can't access the videos with JavaScript directly.
That is why a Chrome Extension is required to enable VU meters, automatic quality adjustment, always staying on LIVE and other features.

## Installation

1. Go to the root of this repo [github.com/AlexFreik/lsm](https://github.com/AlexFreik/lsm) and download it using the "Download ZIP" option (or clone it).
2. Unpack the ZIP.
3. Go to the Chrome Extensions [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/)
4. Switch on Developer mode in the top right corner.
5. Click the "Load unpacked" button and select the `gallery-ext/` folder.

## Update

To update the extension you can remove it and install it again.

If you know how to use Git you can `git pull` the changes and just click
the refresh button.
